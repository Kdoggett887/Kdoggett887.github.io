          Hi! I'm a software engineer with experience in geospatial computing,
          data analytics/visualization, and web scraping. I currently work at
          <a href="https://www.goldfishads.com" target="_blank">Goldfish Ads</a>
          where I build tools for the planning and reporting of OOH campaigns
          with insights based on non-personal, geographic data. Was a co-founder
          of GeoSwap which was acquired by Goldfish in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          My other technical interests include communications systems and sports
          data. I can be found running on the Schuylkill River Trail.
